            GCC, founded in the year 1988, is a name synonymous with innovation
            and excellence in civil engineering and construction. Our success is
            exemplified by the sheer breadth of projects accomplished, spanning
            a wide spectrum, right from infrastructure, defense and leisure to
            industrial, commercial and residential. We have spread our
            excellence from our headquarters in Abu Dhabi, UAE to become a name
            to be reckoned with not just in the nation, but also across several
            countries in the Middle East.

            The company has, along the way, played a vital role in the
            development of the UAEâ€™s infrastructure, while emerging as a
            competitive name in the region. From just a single contract of AED 3
            million in the founding year, we have grown the turnover over the
            past three decades to a staggering AED 5.0 billion (USD 1.35
            billion), thereby setting the pace for quality, progress and
            distinction. The phenomenal growth of GCC and the ambitious plans
            for the future signify our ranking as a premier contractor that is
            all set to scale greater heights
